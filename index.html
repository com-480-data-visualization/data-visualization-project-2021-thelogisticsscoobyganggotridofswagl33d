            <h2>The rules of chess</h2>
            <p>The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces alternately
  on a square board called a chessboard. The objective of each player is to place the opponent’s king ‘under attack’ in such a way that the opponent has no legal move. The player who achieves this goal is said to have
  ‘checkmated’ the opponent’s king and to have won the game. Leaving one’s own king
  under attack, exposing one’s own king to attack and also ’capturing’ the opponent’s king
  are not allowed. The opponent whose king has been checkmated has lost the game. If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate, the game is a draw.</p>
            <p>Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently. Pieces cannot move through other pieces (though the knight can jump over other pieces), and can never move onto a square with one of their own pieces. However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which is then captured. Pieces are generally moved into positions where they can capture other pieces (by landing on their square and then replacing them), defend their own pieces in case of capture, or control important squares in the game.</p>
